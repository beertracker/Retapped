# Retapped Software Development Plan

## Development Workflow - Agile
- **Trello** and **Discord** will be used for project organization and productivity.

- <u> Planning Meeting</u>: Every Three Weeks
	* Mixed: In-person/Discord
- <u>Stand Ups</u>: Weekly
	* Mixed: In-person/Discord
- <u> Refinement Meeting</u>: One Week Before Planning Meeting
	* Mixed: In-person/Discord
- <u>Retro</u>: Prior to the planning meeting
	* Mixed: In-person/Discord

## Proof of Concept
> Our goal is to create an application that can keep track of the drinks that a user has tried, whether they liked it or not, data on the beer, and be able to recommend other beers to the user.

> The project should have personal profiles where users can become "friends" and see what their friends are drinking and what they like.

> This application will have various components such as setting up the database, the web server, & back-end functionality.

> Upon success, users will have an improved alcohol consumption experience, we will make revenue off of advertisements, and local beer businesses will have increased business.

## What is to be Built
### Functionality
- <u>Database</u>: Stores information about alocholic products (e.g. alcoholic %, Brand, Type, etc.)
- <u>Web Server</u>: Make calls to backend services. Intuitive UI that presents data in an elegant way.
- <u>Backend</u>: Handles calls to database. Handles account information. Calls to external API. 

### Constraints
- Limited API calls from free accounts
- Scope of project may be limited to locality and number of included alcoholic beverages.
  
## Finished Project
The Project will be defined as finished when the following features are working as intended:
- **Account creation**
- **Interactive UI**
	* Beverage recommendations
	* Beverage ratings
	* Beverage "sharing"
	* Beverage "finding" with nearby stores
	* Beverage "search"
	* Friendship network
- **Proper interoperability between backend/frontend services**
	* Working web server
	* Working database
	* Working location services
