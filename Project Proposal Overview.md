# Project Proposal Overview

## Details
Team Name: Team Rocket

Team Members:
* Wyatt Rose
* Michael McCain
* Gavin Akehurst
* Kevin Iwatsuki
* Nick Myers

## Synopsis
Our goal is to be able to keep track of the drinks that a user has tried, whether they liked it or not, data on the beer, and be able to recommend other beers to the user. The project should have personal profiles where users can become "friends" and see what their friends are drinking and what they like. This application will have various components such as setting up the database, the web server, & back-end functionality. Upon success, users will have an improved alcohol consumption experience, we will make revenue off of advertisements, and local beer businesses will have increased business.
